The big mistake we tend to do is using Redux for everything and think that React and Redux come together. If you use React it doesn't mean you necessarily need to use Redux. In fact, [@dan_abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) is the first one telling you that [you might not need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367) in your application.

> However, if you’re just learning React, don’t make Redux your first choice. Instead learn to think in React. Come back to Redux if you find a real need for it, or if you want to try something new. But approach it with caution, just like you do with any highly opinionated tool.

## Reasons

1. Persist state to a local storage and then boot up from it, out of the box.
2. Serialize user actions and attach them, together with a state snapshot, to automated bug reports, so that the product developers can replay them to reproduce the errors: https://github.com/dtschust/redux-bug-reporter.
3. Travel between the state history in development: React Redux Devtools (history back, or view state in an action).
4. Same piece of application state needs to be mapped to multiple container components.
5. Global components that can be accessed from anywhere: notifications, modals, tooltips. 
6. Caching page state: when the user does some stuff to a page, then goes to another page and comes back, the expectation usually is to have the page in the same state.
